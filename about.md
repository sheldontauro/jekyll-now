There are a lot of things that I enjoy, from sports to tennis to coding to watching movies. Of all these I have extra enthusiasm for tennis and competitve coding. Economics and finance fascinate me. I am also a member of GeekHaven IIITA where I have a set a few problems for some college coding tests. I am a dedicated federer fan.
